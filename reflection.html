        Optimizing websites for a variety of devices is no longer a choice, but a necessity. The growing variety of smart devices has made it impossible for traditional desktop version websites to provide the right services for customers. The number of mobile devices currently used worldwide is estimated to be over 8 billion. In 2017, mobile devices accounted for more than half of all traffic (53%), and in 2022, that share is expected to reach 73%. Following the advent of laptops, tablets, and smartphones, foldable smartphones that can fold screens have recently appeared. Rather than trying to fit all site pages to different display specifications by manufacturer, it's time to focus on finding ways to show the same content regardless of the device.

        A responsive web design is a methodology that allows you to build a web site optimized for all screens in one source code. There is only one source code that makes up the site, but it displays different layouts fluidly depending on the screen size you are accessing. Unlike 'Adaptive Web Design', which requires the creation and operation of desktop and mobile versions of sites, a single source-built response has a single URL, which is more favorable to exposure to search engines than an adaptive website.

        People often refer to Ethan Marcotte as the creator of responsive web design. But even before 2010, when Ethan first started using the term "reactive" online, there was no clear term, and the concept of reactive was already established. The concept of responsiveness stems from the functional limitations of the Netscape browser in the past, in which page data had to be re-imported from the server whenever the window was resized. Before the term "reactive" was used, the characteristics were mainly described with words such as "flexible", "liquid", "fluid", "elastic". The first responsive website was Audi Dotcom (Audi.com), launched in 2002. Considering that Apple first introduced the iPhone in June 2007, and that key technologies such as CSS media queries didn't begin to settle until early 2009, the first responsive website appeared at an unusually fast.

        In this course, I have learned how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript in frontend where users develop what they see. 
        HTML, abbreviated for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a type of language used to create web documents that travel freely on the web, using the ability to click on a link to another document or site, and tags to separate titles and text.
        CSS, abbreviated for Cascading Style Sheet, is a style sheet that pre-stores the overall style of a web document, and existing HTML has many limitations to design or change web documents from time to time, but it is designed to compensate for their shortcomings. It deals with design elements such as changing fonts and background colors, and is a language that decorates web pages.
        JavaScript dynamically creates pages with static and monotonous limitations of HTML. Although it was mainly used in browsers, recently frameworks and libraries have been actively created, and the language that developers are most interested in is increasing in scalability and frequency of use. This task was completed using DOM, a document object model in these three languages. DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for accessing HTML documents. Based on this, it completed a responsive web design.
